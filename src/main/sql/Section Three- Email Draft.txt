To this I will be writing an email to my Manager (Peter), letting him know about my analysis.

Subject: Data Investigation Summary and Next Steps
Hello Peter,
I hope this message finds you well. Iâ€™ve completed a preliminary analysis of the data and wanted to share a summary of findings, an interesting trend, and recommendations for the next steps.
Key Data Quality Issues and Questions
1.	Placeholder and Inconsistent Values: Fields like MANUFACTURER contain placeholder values (e.g., "PLACEHOLDER MANUFACTL") and inconsistent formatting (e.g., capitalization and spacing variations).
Question: Do we have a standard for handling such placeholders, or should they be excluded in analysis?
2.	Missing Relationships: 17,603 user records in the transactions table lack corresponding entries in the user table, and 4,467 product barcodes in the transactions do not match the product table.
Question: Can we validate the completeness of user and product datasets or identify gaps in the source systems?
3.	Ambiguous Hierarchies: The relationship between CATEGORY_1 to CATEGORY_4 is unclear, making it difficult to understand how they align (e.g., hierarchy or separate dimensions).
Question: Do we have documentation or a business explanation for how these categories are structured?

Interesting Trend in the Data:
Seasonality in Sales: Total sales show a significant spike in July, likely influenced by seasonal promotions and holidays. This trend highlights the importance of targeting campaigns around peak shopping periods.
Generational Insights in Health & Wellness: The Millennials generation accounts 57.27 % of total sales in the "Health & Wellness" category, outperforming all other generations. This suggests a strong preference among Millennials for products in this category, providing a clear direction for targeted marketing efforts

Request for Action:
Metadata and Documentation: Can we get additional context for key fields like CATEGORY_1 to CATEGORY_4, FINAL_SALE, and FINAL_QUANTITY to better understand their definitions and intended use?
Data Validation: Can the relevant teams confirm the integrity of the user and product data, ensuring all entities referenced in transactions are present in their respective tables?
Data Cleanup Support: What guidance or tools can be provided to handle placeholder values and formatting inconsistencies in fields like MANUFACTURER?

Your input will help address these issues and enable us to unlock actionable insights from this dataset. Let me know if we can arrange a quick follow-up to discuss.
Looking forward to your thoughts!
Best regards,
Priti
