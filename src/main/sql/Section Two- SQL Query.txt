1. Who are Fetch’s power users?
Answer:

SELECT 
    u.ID AS User_ID, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT t.RECEIPT_ID) AS Total_Receipts_Scanned, 
    SUM(t.FINAL_SALE) AS Total_Sales
FROM 
    TRANSACTION_TAKEHOME t
JOIN 
    USER_TAKEHOME u 
    ON t.USER_ID = u.ID
GROUP BY 
    u.ID
ORDER BY 
    Total_Sales DESC, 
    Total_Receipts_Scanned DESC
LIMIT 10; -- Top 10 power users

Explanation : This SQL query identifies Fetch's top 10 power users by evaluating their activity and sales contributions. It calculates the total receipts scanned and total sales per user, sorts the results by highest total sales first, and resolves ties by the number of receipts scanned. The LIMIT 10 ensures only the top 10 users are included in the results. Power users are thus defined as those contributing the most sales and activity.
